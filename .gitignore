# The .gitignore file instructs git not to commit certain local files to your repo.
# You generally don't want your repo to include large data files, or local operating system files, for example.
# This is a basic .gitignore file for programming in R.
# To learn more about what .gitignore files are for and which one is right for you, see these resources:
