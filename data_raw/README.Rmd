This folder is for the original copies of your data files. You should consider these files the "master copies", and don't edit them. Save any edited versions of your data files in the folder `data-prepared`.

Files larger than 25 MB should not be synched to Github. Files placed in a subfolder `data-raw/large-files-no-synch` will be ignored by git (via a custom setting in the file `.gitignore`.) These files will not synched to Github.
