Prepared data files
================

This folder is for staging data files after you cleaned and tidied them,
making them ready for analysis.

Files larger than 25 MB should not be synched to Github. Files placed in
a subfolder `data-prepared/large-files-no-synch` will be ignored by git
(via a custom setting in the file `.gitignore`.) These files will not
synched to Github.
